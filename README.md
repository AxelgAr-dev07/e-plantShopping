# e-plantshopping

This project is the front end of the **Paradise Nursery** shopping application.

The application allows users to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart.  
The shopping cart displays selected items, shows the total cost, and allows users to adjust the quantity of each item before checkout.

This project focuses on building the user interface using modern front-end technologies.# coding-project-template
